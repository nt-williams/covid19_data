# COVID-19 data extraction task

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to automate daily extraction and cleaning of
COVID-19 data. Currently the data processed is the publicly available
data through John’s Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science
and Engineering [COVID-19 data
repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and is parsed
into more locale specific files.

R scripts are automatically run at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time and
cleaned data files are automatically uploaded to the `extracted` folder.
